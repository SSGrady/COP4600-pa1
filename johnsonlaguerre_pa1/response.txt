1. Both my Round Robin and First Come, First Served implementations needed correcting. For my Round Robin specifically, I had to fix the order in which process states were evaluated (e.g., arrived, selected, finished).

2. The code was efficient and did not have any unnecessary elements.

3. The code does appear to follow best practices. Variable names were meaningful and very close, if not exactly the same as, what I specified in my prompt.

4. The code can handle errors where a file is not passed and when the input file has the value missing for a variable (e.g., the 5 is missing in "processcount 5").

5. The code does not offer any specific innovations, it simply stuck to the instructions given and provided the necessary implementations.

6. I would rate the overall quality of the code 7/10. It was well-written and stuck to what I asked for in my prompts, but I did have to modify the code to its results match the output files. My experience writing the code with AI would be an 8/10. It saved me a lot of time that I would have spent planning out what I was going to write, testing it, iterating, and fixing bugs. It was a little bit harder than I expected since I had to prompt multiple times to get the pieces I needed to work. I learned the importance of writing descriptive prompts, as that was very helpful in having a good base output to work with. If I had to do something differently, I probably would have spent more time focusing on fixing one issue at a time instead of prompting for different parts of the code in a somewhat disorganized way.
